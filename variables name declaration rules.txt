JavaScript Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Variables:-
Variables are containers for storing data (values).
eg:-var x = 5;

JavaScript Identifiers:-
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum,
            totalVolume).
Java script variables follow camel case conversion
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names


One Statement, Many Variables:-
var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
